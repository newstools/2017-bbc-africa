South Africa's scandal-hit President Jacob Zuma has abandoned a May Day rally after he was booed by workers demanding his resignation. Scuffles also broke between Mr Zuma's supporters and opponents, resulting in all speeches being cancelled. The main labour federation, Cosatu, called on Mr Zuma to step down last month after he sacked his widely respected finance minister. Mr Zuma has vowed to remain in office until his term ends in 2019.
