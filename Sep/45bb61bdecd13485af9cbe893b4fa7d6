The al-Shabab militants rammed the base in Beled Hawa town with an explosives-packed vehicle, and then stormed it on foot, Mohamud Hayd Osman added.Al-Shabab said it had killed 30 soldiers in the hit-and-run attack.It has carried out a spate of attacks in Somalia and Kenya since launching an insurgency more than a decade ago.The African Union has an 18,000-strong force helping the UN-backed Somali government tackle the militants.The assault on Beled Hawa also left dozens of civilians wounded.The militants also blew up the police station and a phone mast, before retreating, Mr Osman added.
