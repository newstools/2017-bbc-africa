South Africa's decision to withdraw from the International Criminal Court (ICC) has been ruled "unconstitutional and invalid" by the High Court.South Africa notified the UN of its intention to leave last October, accusing the ICC of undermining its sovereignty and bias against Africans. But the opposition Democratic Alliance argued that the government had to first seek parliamentary approval. The court ordered the government to revoke its notice of withdrawal.
