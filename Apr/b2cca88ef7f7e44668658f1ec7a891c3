South Africa's embattled president has been backed by a major decision-making body within the ruling ANC.It was looking at a complaint by some of the ANC top executives that Jacob Zuma had failed to consult them over reshuffling his cabinet.After considering the complaint, the ANC has decided not to press for Mr Zuma to resign, a party official said. Mr Zuma has been under growing pressure since sacking respected Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. That led to South Africa's credit rating being cut to junk status putting more pressure on a troubled economy.Mr Gordhan was dropped as part of a major cabinet reshuffle which left some in the ANC leadership questioning whether Mr Zuma should remain as president.Key ANC allies, the South African Communist Party and the main trades union federation Cosatu, joined in the calls for him to go.But the party's National Working Committee (NWC), discussing the cabinet reshuffle, has given the president its backing.The NWC is the ANC's second most important decision-making body.
